## Work Day Scheduler
This repository is used to track the average working day hours of a user making use of local storage.

## Usage
Upon loading up the repository in a web browser, the user will be presented with the current date and time at the top of the screen along with a time block period covering the average working day hours between 9 Am and 5 PM. The user can select time blocks divided into 1 hour periods to enter the tasks/activities/events/meetings/etc and save them into local storage. The scheduler will also update teh time and background colors of the time blocks reflecting a past/present/future appearance to assist the user in focusing on completing the items they add into the scheduler.
